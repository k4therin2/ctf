Your friend is in jail and has written you a strange letter! It seems to be about workout machines, but maybe there is something hidden within the text.<br><br>

Here's what you know: your friend probably wants to communicate something to you. He can't use any complicated cryptography, because he's in jail and they'd totally notice if he was writing down a bunch of figures on a napkin.<br><br>

You remember a conversation you were having with him once upon a time, before he went to jail, about a stupid cryptosystem where you split the alphabet in half, assign a 0 for the first half, a 1 for the second half, take the parity of each word, and somehow map that to the alphabet...<br><br>

<strong>The letter:</strong><br>
<blockquote>
Hi there friend,<br><br>

I have some exciting news about the jail. They recently added a great workout
machine in their good fitness facilities. Very fun fitness machines will allow
their very varied crew in here to hit nice fitness goals.<br><br>

Would I have your goals? No, you shouldn't have goals of less abs. That would
scarcely make any sense.<br><br>

Bye!
