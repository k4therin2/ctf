<h2>18</h2>

<p>
    The evil CTF cyborg overlords have taken control of Glennan. They've replaced the RFID scanners with password locks which change every 5 minutes.
    They've been communicating the passwords to eachother via beep noises.
</p>
<p>
    The rebel forces have managed to take one of them down- you've hacked into their system and found the program they use to encode messages into the beeps.
</p>
<p>
    To escape Glennan and help save the school, crack the current password!
