<h2>39</h2>

<p>
Your friend, a Harvard English professor, is in jail and has written you a strange letter! It seems to be about workout machines, but maybe there is something hidden within the text.
</p>

<p>
Here's what you know: your friend probably wants to communicate something to you. He can't use any complicated cryptography, because he's in jail and they'd totally notice if he was writing down a bunch of figures on a napkin.
</p>

<p>
You remember a conversation you were having with him once upon a time, before he went to jail, about a stupid cryptosystem where you split the alphabet in half, assign a 0 for the first half, a 1 for the second half, take the parity of each word, and somehow map that to the alphabet...
</p>

<h4>The letter:</h4>
<blockquote style="font-size: 14px">
Hi good dear,<br><br>

I have some exciting info about the jail. They recently added a great workout
device within their good fitness area. Very fun fitness devices will allow
their very varied crew in here to hit nice fitness goals.<br><br>

If I have your goals? No, you shouldn't have goals of less abs. That be
scarcely make any sense.<br><br>

Bye!
