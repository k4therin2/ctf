Flag 13

A further hint:

If you follow the link, you find a Github repository. The last commit (at the
time of the CTF event) says "removed flag". If you click on that [commit][] you
will see that a single line is removed:

```
flag{mailto:has_somebody_pooped@case.edu}
```

(Answer: yes. Somebody has pooped at Case.)
